            <img class="featured" src="carnival.jpg">Given the problem statement will focus on --- "How might we make a devoted script 
            murder/mystery game fan who wants to plan 约本 activities (who) address the problem of scattered information, lack of source about 
            约本 activities and online community (what) so that she/he can realize 约本 activities with other players (why)?", 
            the scope of the future journey and story mapping exercise will be restricted to #5,#6 and #8 of the following steps: <br>
            1) Find a script<br>
            2) Examine and decide on a script<br>
            3) Find a venue<br>
            4) Examine and decide on a venue<br>
            5) Join a 约本 community<br>
            6) Signup a 约本activity<br>
            7) Attend the activity at a chosen venue<br>
            8) Contribute comments to the community<br>
        </p>
            <br>

        <p>
            In addition, the solution aims to monetize the player experience by developing a community platform business model, 
            connecting the die-hard murder/mystery game fans with the game club organizers. This serves to eliminate the time originally 
            spent by the fans to find the scripts and locate the venues. Now, just by joining (paid subscription) the platform, the scripts and venues
            information will be delivered to the members through active involvement of the club owners in supplying the needed contents.
            To further narrow the scope, the geographical location that has been targeted for a pilot market entry evalution is "Wenzhou温州"
        </p><br>
        <p>    
            A usability test will also be conducted to validate the monetization logic of engaging the targeted players to subscribe to the community membership.
